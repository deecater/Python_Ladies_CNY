# Difficulty level: Advanced

# Goal #1: Create a program that will print out a list of movie titles and a set of ratings defined below into a particular format.

# First, choose any five movies you want.

# Next, look each movie up manually to find out four pieces of information:
#		Their parental guidance rating (G, PG, PG-13, R)
#		Their Bechdel Test Rating (See http://shannonvturner.com/bechdel or http://bechdeltest.com/)
#		Their IMDB Rating from 0 - 10 (See http://imdb.com/)
# 		Their genre according to IMDB

# After a few more lessons, you'll be able to tell Python to go out and get that information for you, but for now you'll have to collect it on your own.

# Now that you've written down each piece of information for all five of your movies, save them into variables.

# You'll need a variable for movie_titles, a variable for parental_rating, a variable for bechdel_rating, a variable for imdb_rating, and a variable for genre.


# Since you have five sets of facts about five movies, you'll want to use lists to hold these pieces of information.

movie_titles = ["Spirited Away", "Kiki's Delivery Service", "Howl's Moving Castle", "Princess Mononoke", "Ponyo"]


parental_rating = ["PG", "G", "PG", "PG-13", "G"]


bechdel_rating = ["3", "3", "3", "3", "3"]


imdb_rating = [8.6, 7.9, 8.2, 8.4, 7.7]


movie_genre = ["Animation, Adventure Family", "Adventure, Animation, Drama", "Adventure, Animation, Family", "Adventure, Animation, Fantasy", "Adventure, Animation, Family, Fantasy"]


# Once all of your information is stored in lists, loop through those lists to print out information with each part separated by a comma, like this:

# Example:
# Jurassic Park, PG-13, 3, 8.0, Adventure / Sci-Fi
# Back to the Future, PG, 1, 8.5, Adventure / Comedy / Sci-Fi

for i in range (0,5):
	print "{0}, {1}, {2}, {3},{4}".format(movie_titles[i],parental_rating[i], bechdel_rating[i], imdb_rating[i], movie_genre[i])


# Note how each piece of information is separated by a comma.  This is a specific file format called the "Comma Separated Value (CSV)" format
# If you can make a CSV file, you can open it up in Excel or Numbers as a spreadsheet.

# When you've printed out your information like the example above, copy/paste that into a file and save it as a .csv file.
# Open that up in Excel, Numbers, or another spreadsheet program.  How does it look?
